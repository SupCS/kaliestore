This is basically my first fully-built website created for my course work in the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. I have also transfered this plain html, css, js code to laravel, so i also added some backend features, such as working with database, filters, choosing of product properties (size, color, etc.), form sending to email functionality ( https://github.com/SupCS/kaliework ) Design is also created by me: https://www.figma.com/file/aWc18Hj1rWLWI5SRCLYYKP/Kalie?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=2CI0d2McQHNtSBBK-1
